# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-Pandas

## Introduction
This project explores a world population dataset using Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Aim of the project
The main is to gain insights into global demographics and uncover interesting patterns and relationships within the world population data.

### Questions
1. Which countries have the highest and lowest world population percentage?
2. Which countries have the highest and lowest growth rate?
3. How does the population in various year correlate to each other?
## Procedure used
1. The first steps in performing an EDA is to get an overall view of the data
   * use **df.describe()** this gives you a quick summary of the columns including the count, mean, std, min and max values
   * Identify null values, because they can interfere with the overall analysis. use **df.isnull().sum()** to get a sum of the null values
